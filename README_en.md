- xxHash for hash values, saving 20% ~ 70% of computing time.
- Supports automatic deletion of old backups and retaining the specified number of backups.

---

The backup archive will be stored in the `better_backup` folder with the following directory format:
```python
mcd_root/
    better_backup/
        cache/ # Backup files
            00/
                ...
            0a/
            0b/
                ...

        export_backup/
            ...

        overwrite/
            ...
        
        storage.db # database
```
